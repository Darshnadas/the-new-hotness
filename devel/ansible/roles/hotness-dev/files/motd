Welcome to The New Hotness development environment!

Here are some tips:

* The code for the-new-hotness is located at ~/devel/

* Run `hotstart` to start the development services and `hotstop` to stop it.

* Logs for the server are available with `journalctl`; the services are run
  as systemd user units in ~/.config/systemd/user/

Happy hacking!
